### **E-Commerce Chatbot using BERT**

This project is a Streamlit-based e-commerce chatbot that answers user questions about products using a pretrained BERT model for Question Answering (QA). The chatbot works on the Flipkart Product Dataset, enabling users to ask queries like product price, category, and description.

---

### **Features**

- **Product Selection**: Users can select a product from the Flipkart dataset.
- **Question Answering**: Answers user queries using BERT for QA.
- **Contextual Understanding**: Leverages product-specific context for precise answers.
- **Regex-based Post-Processing**: Extracts specific details (e.g., price) from model responses.
- **Interactive UI**: Built with Streamlit for a smooth user experience.
